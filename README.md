Many engineers have never worked in statistics or data science.
But to properly build a data pipeline or rewrite the code generated by a data scientist,
The code is easy to maintain, and there are many nuances and misunderstandings in engineering.
For data engineers/machine learning and new data scientists, I am doing this series of articles. 

The whole series:

Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
Demystifying hypothesis testing
Data Science. Probability
Data Science. Bayes theorem
Data Science. Probability distributions
Data Science. Measures
Data Science. Correlation
Data Science. The Central Limit Theorem and sampling
