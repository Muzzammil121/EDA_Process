Many engineers have never worked in statistics or data science.
But to properly build a data pipeline or rewrite the code generated by a data scientist,
The code is easy to maintain, and there are many nuances and misunderstandings in engineering.
For data engineers/machine learning and new data scientists, I am doing this series of articles. 

The whole series:

Descriptive and Inferential Statistics
Demystifying hypothesis testing
Data Science. Probability
Data Science. Bayes theorem
Data Science. Probability distributions
